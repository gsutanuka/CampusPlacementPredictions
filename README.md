# Campus Placement Prediction

Often, there is this uncertainty among students about placements. What if there is a way to know your chances of getting placed? This will not only give the students a heads up but will also motivate them to work harder and seek help from teachers and others in time.

In this project, we consider a placement dataset and try to predict whether a candidate will be placed or not based on his/her past records with the help of Machine Learning.

## Problem Statement

To build ML models that will correctly classify whether a student is placed or not, compare them and find the best model for the classification.

## Data Description

This is a placement data consisting from a certain campus of students pursuing MBA in Marketing and Finance and Marketing and HR.
